    <h1>My Rock</h1>
    <img alt="a very special rock" src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftse4.mm.bing.net%2Fth%3Fid%3DOIP.dngfVrYSO977DFznfQ0W3wHaE8%26pid%3DApi&f=1" />
    <p>This is a rock. It is not actually my rock. It is just a random rock I found on the internet.</p>
    <p>This rock is my favorite because:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>It is the first one I found that seemed right for this when I searched.</li>
        <li>It has nice texture.</li>
    </ul>
